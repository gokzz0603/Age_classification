# Age_classification
Engineered a CNN model with 95% accuracy in classifying images into 5 distinct age categories.  Extensively tested on a dataset with 125 images, demonstrating the modelâ€™s robustness in real-world scenarios.  Applied deep learning techniques to enhance classification precision, optimizing the model for diverse age group predictions.
